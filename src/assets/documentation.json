  "content": "# Installation Guide: Setting Up Your Job Platform\n\nGetting each component of yourjobplatform up and running is quick and easy. Follow these detailed steps for each repository.\n\n## 1. Frontend Repository (Create React App)\n\nThis is your user-facing application built with Create React App.\n\n### Installation Steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired development directory. Then, run:\n    ```bash\n    git clone <frontend_repo_url>\n    cd <frontend_repo_directory>\n    ```\n    *Replace `<frontend_repo_url>` with the actual URL of your frontend GitHub/GitLab/etc. repository.* \n    *Replace `<frontend_repo_directory>` with the name of the folder created after cloning (usually the repository name).* \n\n2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all required libraries and packages for your React application.\n\n3.  **Configure Environment Variables (Crucial for API Connections):**\n    Your frontend needs to know where your backend APIs are located. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your frontend project (if it doesn't already exist). Add the following variables, replacing the placeholder URLs with the ports you plan to run your backends on:\n    ```plaintext\n    # Example .env file for the frontend\n    REACT_APP_JOB_LISTING_API_URL=http://localhost:5000\n    REACT_APP_HIRENVOVA_API_URL=http://localhost:5001\n    ```\n    *Make sure these URLs exactly match the ports configured in your respective backend applications.*\n\n### Running the Frontend:\n\nTo start the development server for your React application:\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\nThis command will typically open your application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port). The terminal will usually indicate the address.\n\n## 2. Job Listing Backend (Express.js/Node.js)\n\nThis backend is responsible for handling job data, including fetching, filtering, sorting, and serving it to your frontend. It's built with Express.js and Node.js.\n\n### Installation Steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:** Navigate to your desired development directory (different from your frontend directory) and run:\n    ```bash\n    git clone <job_listing_backend_repo_url>\n    cd <job_listing_backend_repo_directory>\n    ```\n    *Replace `<job_listing_backend_repo_url>` with the actual URL of your job listing backend repository.*\n\n2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n    This installs all server-side dependencies defined in this project's `package.json`.\n\n3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**\n    This backend will require a `.env` file for its own configurations, such as the port it listens on, database connection strings, and any API keys it might use.\n    Create a file named `.env` in the root of this project and add variables. For example:\n    ```plaintext\n    # Example .env file for the Job Listing Backend\n    PORT=5000\n    DATABASE_URL=your_job_listing_database_connection_string\n    # Add any other specific configurations (e.g., external API keys for job boards)\n    ```\n    *Ensure the `PORT` specified here (`5000` in this example) matches the `REACT_APP_JOB_LISTING_API_URL` set in your frontend's `.env` file.*\n\n### Running the Job Listing Backend:\n\nTo start the Express.js server:\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n*(This assumes your `package.json` has a `start` script defined, e.g., \"start\": \"node server.js\". If not, you might need to run `node server.js` or `node app.js` depending on your main server file.)*\n\nThe server will typically run on the port you configured (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). Check your terminal for confirmation messages.\n\n## 3. HireOnova Backend (Express.js/Node.js)\n\nThis backend is responsible for user management, authentication, user profiles, and handling resume information. It's also built with Express.js and Node.js.\n\n### Installation Steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:** Navigate to your desired development directory (different from the other two backend directories) and run:\n    ```bash\n    git clone <hireonova_backend_repo_url>\n    cd <hireonova_backend_repo_directory>\n    ```\n    *Replace `<hireonova_backend_repo_url>` with the actual URL of your HireOnova backend repository.*\n\n2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n    This installs all server-side dependencies for the user/resume management system.\n\n3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**\n    Create a file named `.env` in the root of this project for its specific configurations.\n    ```plaintext\n    # Example .env file for the HireOnova Backend\n    PORT=5001\n    DATABASE_URL=your_user_resume_database_connection_string\n    JWT_SECRET=a_very_long_and_random_secret_key_for_jwt_auth\n    # Add any other specific configurations (e.g., cloud storage credentials for resumes)\n    ```\n    *Ensure the `PORT` specified here (`5001` in this example) matches the `REACT_APP_HIRENVOVA_API_URL` set in your frontend's `.env` file.*\n    *For `JWT_SECRET`, generate a strong, random string (e.g., using `node -e \"console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))\"`).*\n\n### Running the HireOnova Backend:\n\nTo start the Express.js server:\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n*(Again, this assumes a `start` script in `package.json`. Adjust if needed.)*\n\nThe server will typically run on the port you configured (e.g., `http://localhost:5001`). Check your terminal for confirmation messages.\n\n## 4. Job Scraping Script (Python)\n\nThis repository contains the Python script responsible for scraping job listings from various sources using libraries like `langchain`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Scrapy`. It then processes this information (potentially with `lama` for NLP tasks) and likely inserts it into your job listing database.\n\n### Installation Steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:** Navigate to your desired development directory and run:\n    ```bash\n    git clone <scraping_script_repo_url>\n    cd <scraping_script_repo_directory>\n    ```\n    *Replace `<scraping_script_repo_url>` with the actual URL of your Python scraping script repository.*\n\n2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (Highly Recommended):**\n    Virtual environments help isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your system. Run the following commands:\n    ```bash\n    python3 -m venv venv\n    ```\n    *On some systems, `python` might be used instead of `python3`.*\n\n3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**\n    *On macOS/Linux:* \n    ```bash\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n    *On Windows (Command Prompt):* \n    ```bash\n    venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n    ```\n    *On Windows (PowerShell):* \n    ```bash\n    .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n    ```\n    You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.\n\n4.  **Install Python dependencies:**\n    Your project includes a `REQUIREMENTS.txt` file listing all necessary Python libraries (`langchain`, `lama`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, etc.). Install them using pip:\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt\n    ```\n\n5.  **Configure Environment Variables (if any):**\n    Your scraping script might need environment variables for API keys (e.g., for `langchain` if using external LLMs), database credentials to store scraped data, or specific scraping configurations. Check the script's documentation or code for any required `.env` variables.\n    If needed, create a `.env` file in the root of this project. Example:\n    ```plaintext\n    # Example .env file for the Scraping Script\n    DATABASE_URL_FOR_JOBS=your_job_listing_database_connection_string\n    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key\n    # Add any other scraping specific configs\n    ```\n\n### Running the Job Scraping Script:\n\nTo run your Python scraping script, you'll typically execute the main script file. For example:\n```bash\npython3 main_scraper"

                {
                    "id": "configuration",
                    "title": "Configuration Options",
                    "content": "# Configuration Options\n\nCustomize each part of your job platform to fit your specific needs with our flexible configuration system.\n\n## Environment Variables (Recommended)\n\nFor sensitive information (like API keys, database credentials) and environment-specific settings (like API URLs, ports), we strongly recommend using environment variables. This keeps sensitive data out of your codebase and allows for easy configuration changes between development, testing, and production environments.\n\nFor Node.js applications (frontend and both backends), you typically use a `.env` file in the root of each project. These variables are loaded at runtime by libraries like `dotenv`.\n\nFor Python scripts, you can also use a `.env` file and load variables using libraries like `python-dotenv`.\n\n### Common Environment Variables Across Repositories:\n\n-   `PORT`: The port number on which the Node.js application (frontend dev server, backend servers) will listen. Ensure unique ports for each running service (e.g., 3000 for frontend, 5000 for job listing backend, 5001 for HireOnova backend).\n-   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your database. This will vary depending on your database type (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL).\n\n### Frontend (`.env`):\n\n```plaintext\n# Frontend API Endpoints\nREACT_APP_JOB_LISTING_API_URL=http://localhost:5000\nREACT_APP_HIRENVOVA_API_URL=http://localhost:5001\n```\n\n### Job Listing Backend (`.env`):\n\n```plaintext\n# Server Port\nPORT=5000\n\n# Database Connection\nDATABASE_URL=your_job_listing_database_connection_string_here\n\n# Optional: Any third-party job board API keys\nINDEED_API_KEY=your_indeed_api_key\n```\n\n### HireOnova Backend (`.env`):\n\n```plaintext\n# Server Port\nPORT=5001\n\n# Database Connection\nDATABASE_URL=your_hireonova_database_connection_string_here\n\n# JWT Secret for Authentication (VERY IMPORTANT: Make this a strong, random string)\nJWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key\n\n# Optional: Cloud storage credentials for resume uploads\nAWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key\n```\n\n### Job Scraping Script (`.env`):\n\n```plaintext\n# Database where scraped jobs will be stored (often the same as Job Listing Backend's DB)\nJOB_DB_URL=your_job_listing_database_connection_string_here\n\n# Optional: API keys for LLMs if 'langchain' or 'lama' use external services\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_if_used\n\n# Optional: Proxy settings for scraping\nPROXY_URL=http://your_proxy_server:port\n```\n\n## Advanced Options\n\nFor advanced users, additional configuration options might be available within the application code itself or through specific configuration files for libraries like Scrapy.\n\n-   **Scrapy Settings:** Check the `settings.py` file within your Scrapy project (part of the scraping repo) for detailed crawler configurations, delays, user agents, etc.\n-   **CORS Policies:** In your Express.js backends, ensure you configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers to allow your frontend to make requests. During development, you might set it to allow all origins (`*`), but in production, you should restrict it to your frontend's domain."

                    "content": "# Authentication\n\nSecure your API calls with our robust authentication system. The HireOnova Backend handles user authentication, typically using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\n\n## JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication\n\nAfter a user successfully logs in via the HireOnova Backend, they will receive a JWT. This token must be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests to protected API endpoints.\n\n### Example Request with JWT:\n\n```javascript\nconst userToken = 'YOUR_JWT_HERE'; // Obtained after login\n\nconst response = await fetch('/api/data', {\n  headers: {\n    'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`\n  }\n});\n\nif (response.ok) {\n  const data = await response.json();\n  console.log('Protected data:', data);\n} else {\n  console.error('Authentication failed or unathorized:', response.statusText);\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices for Authentication\n\n-   **Never expose secrets:** Ensure your `JWT_SECRET` (used by HireOnova Backend) and any other API keys are kept secure using environment variables and are never hardcoded or exposed in client-side code.\n-   **Token Storage:** On the client-side (frontend), store JWTs securely. Options include `localStorage` (less secure but common for simple apps), `sessionStorage`, or more robust solutions like HttpOnly cookies.\n-   **Token Refresh:** Implement logic to refresh expired JWTs to maintain user sessions without requiring re-login.\n-   **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input on the server-side to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.\n-   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production environments to encrypt communication between the client and server, protecting sensitive data like tokens and credentials.\n-   **CORS Configuration:** Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your backend servers to allow only your trusted frontend domain to access your APIs."

While specific structures may vary by language and framework, general principles apply:\n\n```\n# Example for a Node.js Express Backend\nsrc/\n ├── config/            # Configuration files (e.g., database, environment)\n ├── controllers/       # Request handlers (logic for routes)\n ├── models/            # Database schemas/models\n ├── routes/            # API route definitions\n ├── services/          # Business logic, complex operations\n ├── utils/             # Helper functions, utilities\n ├── middleware/        # Express middleware\n └── app.js             # Main application entry point\n\n# Example for a React Frontend (CRA)\nsrc/\n ├── assets/            # Images, fonts, icons\n ├── components/        # Reusable UI components\n │   ├── common/      # Generic components (buttons, modals)\n │   └── layout/      # Layout components (header, footer, sidebar)\n ├── pages/             # Page-specific components/views\n ├── services/          # API client calls, data fetching logic\n ├── contexts/          # React Context API providers\n ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks\n ├── utils/             # Utility functions\n ├── styles/            # Global styles, TailwindCSS config\n └── App.js             # Main application component\n```\n\n## Performance Tips\n\nOptimize your applications for speed and responsiveness to provide a smooth user experience:\n\n1.  **Lazy Loading (Frontend):** Load React components and routes only when they are needed, rather than bundling everything upfront. Use `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.\n2.  **Memoization (Frontend):** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and recalculations of expensive values/functions.\n3.  **Bundle Splitting (Frontend):** Configure your build process (CRA does this by default) to split your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks, leading to faster initial page loads.\n4.  **Database Indexing (Backends):** Ensure your database tables have appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `jobTitle`, `location`, `email`) to speed up query execution.\n5.  **Caching (Backends):** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache) for frequently accessed but slowly changing data (e.g., popular job listings).\n6.  **Optimized Queries (Backends):** Write efficient database queries. Avoid N+1 query problems and select only the columns you need.\n7.  **Rate Limiting (Backends):** Protect your APIs from abuse and ensure fair usage by implementing rate limiting.\n8.  **Asynchronous Operations (All):** Leverage asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await) to prevent blocking the main thread during I/O operations.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nSecurity is paramount for any web application. Implement these practices across your platform:\n\n-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Always validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server-side to prevent common attacks like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and command injection.\n-   **HTTPS in Production:** Deploy your frontend and backend applications with HTTPS enabled to encrypt all data in transit, protecting sensitive information like passwords and JWTs.\n-   **Environment Variables for Secrets:** Store all sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, JWT secrets) as environment variables, not directly in your code.\n-   **CORS Policies:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) explicitly on your backend servers. In production, only allow requests from your trusted frontend domain.\n-   **Authentication Best Practices:**\n    -   Use strong, salted, and hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt).\n    -   Implement secure JWT handling (short expiry, refresh tokens).\n    -   Protect routes with proper authentication middleware.\n-   **Authorization:** Implement clear authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to.\n-   **Regular Security Audits & Updates:** Regularly review your code for security vulnerabilities and keep all your dependencies (npm packages, Python libraries) updated to their latest secure versions.\n-   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling that does not leak sensitive information to the client in error messages.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\nWrite comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your applications:\n\n-   **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual functions, methods, or components in isolation. These are fast and help verify the correctness of small pieces of logic.\n    -   *Tools:* Jest (JavaScript), Pytest (Python).\n-   **Integration Tests:** Verify that different modules or services interact correctly with each other (e.g., frontend components interacting with the API, backend services interacting with the database).\n-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate real user scenarios to test the entire application flow from start to finish. These are slower but provide high confidence in the overall system.\n    -   *Tools:* Cypress, Playwright, Selenium.\n-   **API Tests:** Specifically test your backend API endpoints to ensure they respond correctly to various requests and edge cases.\n    -   *Tools:* Jest (for Node.js APIs), Pytest (for Python APIs), Postman (manual/automated).\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, you'll build a more robust, secure, and performant job platform."

                    "content": "# Debugging and Troubleshooting Your Job Platform\n\nSometimes things don’t go as planned across your interconnected services. Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered with strategies and tools for effective debugging.\n\n## Common Errors and Fixes\n\nHere are some frequently encountered issues when running multi-service applications:\n\n-   **`Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::[PORT]` (Backend/Frontend):**\n    -   **Meaning:** Another process is already using the port your application is trying to listen on.\n    -   **Fix:** Ensure each backend and your frontend development server is running on a unique port. Check `netstat` or Activity Monitor/Task Manager to find and kill the process using the port, or change the port in your `.env` files (e.g., `PORT=5002`).\n\n-   **`Failed to fetch` or Network Error (Frontend):**\n    -   **Meaning:** Your frontend cannot connect to one of your backend APIs.\n    -   **Fixes:**\n        -   Verify the backend service is actually running.\n        -   Check the `REACT_APP_JOB_LISTING_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_HIRENVOVA_API_URL` in your frontend's `.env` file to ensure they match the exact URLs and ports your backends are running on.\n        -   Check your browser's developer console (Network tab) for CORS errors. If present, ensure your backend servers (`Job Listing Backend`, `HireOnova Backend`) have correctly configured CORS headers to allow requests from your frontend's origin (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).\n\n-   **`Error 500 (Internal Server Error)` (Backend):**\n    -   **Meaning:** Something went wrong on the server-side. This is a generic error.\n    -   **Fix:** Check the server logs (the terminal where your backend is running) for detailed error messages and stack traces. These will pinpoint the exact line of code causing the issue (e.g., database connection error, unhandled exception in a route handler).\n\n-   **`Error 404 (Not Found)` (API Endpoint):**\n    -   **Meaning:** The requested API endpoint does not exist or the URL is incorrect.\n    -   **Fix:** Double-check the API endpoint path and method (GET, POST, etc.) in both your frontend calls and your backend route definitions. Ensure your backend server is indeed serving the expected routes.\n\n-   **`Error 401 (Unauthorized)` (API Endpoint):**\n    -   **Meaning:** The request to a protected API endpoint was made without a valid authentication token.\n    -   **Fix:** Verify that the JWT is correctly obtained from the HireOnova Backend after login, is not expired, and is being sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected routes.\n\n-   **Python `ModuleNotFoundError` (Scraping Script):**\n    -   **Meaning:** A required Python library is not installed or the virtual environment is not activated.\n    -   **Fix:** Ensure your virtual environment is active (`(venv)` in your terminal prompt) and you have run `pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt` to install all dependencies.\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\n-   **Enable Debug Mode:** If your backends or frontend have a `DEBUG` environment variable, set it to `true` to get more verbose logging.\n-   **`console.log()`/`print()`:** Sprinkle `console.log()` (JavaScript) or `print()` (Python) statements strategically throughout your code to trace variable values and execution flow.\n-   **Browser Developer Tools:**\n    -   **Console Tab:** Look for JavaScript errors and messages.\n    -   **Network Tab:** Inspect all network requests made by your frontend. Check request URLs, methods, headers, and especially the responses (status codes and body) from your backend APIs.\n-   **Node.js Debugger:** Utilize the built-in Node.js debugger. Start your Node.js application with `node --inspect <your_main_file.js>` and connect a debugger client (e.g., Chrome DevTools or VS Code's debugger).\n-   **Python Debugger (`pdb`):** For Python scripts, you can insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` at any point to pause execution and inspect variables interactively.\n-   **Log Files:** Configure your backend applications to log errors and important events to files. Review these logs for persistent issues.\n\n## Helpful Tools\n\n-   **Postman / Insomnia:** Essential tools for testing your API endpoints independently of the frontend. You can send custom requests, include headers (like Authorization tokens), and inspect responses.\n-   **`nodemon` (for Node.js):** A utility that automatically restarts your Node.js server whenever code changes are detected, saving you from manually restarting it during development.\n    -   Install: `npm install -g nodemon`\n    -   Use: `nodemon server.js`\n-   **`docker-compose` (Advanced):** For complex setups with many services, `docker-compose` can streamline the process of running all your applications in isolated containers, simplifying dependency management and ensuring consistent environments.\n\nBy systematically applying these debugging techniques, you'll be able to quickly identify and resolve issues across your job platform."

                    "content": "# Advanced Features of Your Job Platform\n\nTake your project to the next level with these advanced platform features and concepts.\n\n## Custom Middleware (Node.js Backends)\n\nYou can create custom middleware functions in your Express.js backends to intercept and process requests at various stages of the request-response cycle. This is powerful for tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, and data manipulation.\n\n### Example: Simple Logging Middleware\n\n```javascript\n// In your app.js or a separate middleware file\n\nfunction requestLogger(req, res, next) {\n  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();\n  console.log(`[${timestamp}] ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl}`);\n  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware/route handler\n}\n\n// Use the middleware in your Express app\napp.use(requestLogger);\n\n// Example: Middleware to check API Key (simplified)\nfunction checkApiKey(req, res, next) {\n  const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key'];\n  if (!apiKey || apiKey !== process.env.STATIC_API_KEY) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized: Invalid API Key' });\n  }\n  next();\n}\n\n// Apply to specific routes\napp.get('/api/admin/data', checkApiKey, (req, res) => {\n  res.json({ secret: 'admin data' });\n});\n```\n\n## Real-Time Updates (WebSockets)\n\nFor features like live job updates, chat functionalities (e.g., recruiter-candidate chat), or real-time notifications, WebSockets offer a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between client and server.\n\nLibraries like Socket.IO (for Node.js) simplify WebSocket implementation.\n\n### Server-Side (Node.js using Socket.IO):\n\n```javascript\n// In your Job Listing Backend (or a separate microservice)\nconst express = require('express');\nconst http = require('http');\nconst { Server } = require('socket.io');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst server = http.createServer(app);\nconst io = new Server(server, {\n  cors: {\n    origin: \"http://localhost:3000\", // Allow your frontend\n    methods: [\"GET\", \"POST\"]\n  }\n});\n\nio.on('connection', (socket) => {\n  console.log('A user connected:', socket.id);\n\n  // Example: Emit new job alert\n  setInterval(() => {\n    const newJob = { id: Date.now(), title: 'New Job Alert!', location: 'Remote' };\n    socket.emit('newJobPosted', newJob); // Send to this client\n    io.emit('jobFeedUpdate', { message: 'A new job was posted!' }); // Send to all connected clients\n  }, 5000);\n\n  socket.on('disconnect', () => {\n    console.log('User disconnected:', socket.id);\n  });\n\n  socket.on('subscribeToJobUpdates', () => {\n    console.log(`${socket.id} subscribed to job updates.`);\n    // Logic to add socket to a room or list for job updates\n  });\n});\n\nserver.listen(5002, () => {\n  console.log('WebSocket server listening on *:5002');\n});\n```\n\n### Client-Side (React Frontend):\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { io } from 'socket.io-client';\n\nconst JobFeed = () => {\n  const [latestJob, setLatestJob] = useState(null);\n  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const socket = io('http://localhost:5002'); // Connect to your WebSocket server\n\n    socket.on('connect', () => {\n      console.log('Connected to WebSocket server');\n      socket.emit('subscribeToJobUpdates');\n    });\n\n    socket.on('newJobPosted', (job) => {\n      console.log('New job received:', job);\n      setLatestJob(job);\n    });\n\n    socket.on('jobFeedUpdate', (data) => {\n      setNotifications(prev => [...prev, data.message]);\n    });\n\n    socket.on('disconnect', () => {\n      console.log('Disconnected from WebSocket server');\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n      socket.disconnect(); // Clean up on component unmount\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Real-time Job Feed</h2>\n      {latestJob && (\n        <p>Latest Job: {latestJob.title} at {latestJob.location}</p>\n      )}\n      <div>\n        <h3>Notifications:</h3>\n        {notifications.map((msg, index) => <p key={index}>{msg}</p>)}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default JobFeed;\n```\n\n## Performance Tuning Strategies\n\nBeyond basic optimizations, consider these for high-performance applications:\n\n-   **Database Optimization:**\n    -   **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage database connections in your backends to reduce overhead.\n    -   **Query Optimization:** Use `EXPLAIN` (SQL) or profiling tools to understand and optimize slow queries.\n    -   **Denormalization:** For read-heavy applications, strategically denormalize data to reduce the number of joins required.\n-   **Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability and scalability.\n-   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Serve static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) from geographically distributed servers via a CDN to reduce latency for users worldwide.\n-   **Serverless Functions:** For specific, infrequent, or burstable tasks (like image processing, certain scraping triggers), consider using serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to offload work and scale automatically.\n-   **Background Processing (Job Queues):** For long-running or resource-intensive tasks (e.g., large-scale data scraping, resume parsing), use job queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS) to process them asynchronously without blocking the main application thread."
